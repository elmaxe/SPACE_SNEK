A giant space snek
Eats stars and planets (spacedust)
Is chased by black holes. If the tail is caught into one, the snake will slowly get sucked into the hole (your tail gets shorter).
You can get your tail out of a black hole.

Easter egg/rare things: Planet Earth can rarely spawn which you can eat if you want to.
